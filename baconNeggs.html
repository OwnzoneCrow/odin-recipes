        <p>For making this meal we will need to use a pan, a fork, and/or a spatula.
            Our ingredients are as followed:
            <ul>
               <li class="ingredients"> <span> <strong>Bacon </strong>(any amount) </span></li>
                <li class="ingredients"> <span> <strong>Eggs</strong> (any amount) </span></li>
               <li class="ingredients"> <span> <strong>Salt and Pepper</strong> </span></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We will create our simple breakfast in the following steps:
            <ol>
               <li> Insert the bacon inside the pan.</li> 
               <li> Flip the bacon when browning continues and cook to your liking. (The longer it cooks, the darker/harder it gets) </li>
               <li> Take the bacon out of the pan and do <strong>NOT</strong> drain/clean the pan. We will use the grease for our eggs. </li>
               <li> Crack the eggs into the pan. Avoid getting any eggshells inside the pan. </li>
               <li> Whisk the eggs inside the pan and make sure they are completely liquified into a yellowish paste. </li>
               <li> From here will use you spatula or fork to move the eggs around. We want to avoid the eggs sticking on to the pan. The eggs will cook quickly.</li>
               <li> During or after the eggs are cooking, feel free to use salt and pepper to give flavor. With this, you are able to enjoy your meal!</li>
            </ol>

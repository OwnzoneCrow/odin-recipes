    <p>For this recipe we will need to use a pan and many bowls and plates. While this style of tacos are not the best, it's pretty easy to do and available everywhere.</p>
    <p>Our ingredients are as followed (for 2 people):
        <ul>
            <li><strong>500g of ground beef or beef/pork mix</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>10 flour tortillas</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 packet of taco seasoning</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Half a cup to 1 cup of water</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Additional toppings are great as well, here are some examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Salsa</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For cooking our Gringo Tacos we will do the following
        <ol>
            <li>Put a small amount of olive oil in the pan and heat the pan for about 5 minutes. Make sure to have the oil move around the pan.</li>
            <li>Insert the meat into the pan. Stir and ground the meat from time to time and wait until it is cooked.</li>
            <li>Drain the liquid from the pan.</li>
            <li>Insert the taco seasoning and the water. Make sure the water covers most of the meat.</li>
            <li>Stir the meat again and wait for the water to boil. This takes about 10-15 minutes on medium heat</li>
            <li>We will drain our pan again, afterwards we are able to use the meat in our tacos.</li>
            <li>Add any extra toppings to your tacos and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

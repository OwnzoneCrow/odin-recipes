        <p>For making this ramen we will need to use a plastic bowl and a microwave/range to heat the noodles. Making this ramen is so easy even a child can do this with no problems.
            Our ingredients are as followed:
            <ul>
               <li> <strong>Ramen Noodles </strong>(as seen above) </li>
                <li> <strong>Water</strong> (approxiamtely 400-500 mL depending on the noodles) </li>
               <li> <strong>Soup Powder</strong> (which is located along with the noodles) </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We will create our delicious but super cheap ramen in the following steps:
            <ol>
               <li> Open the noodle package and insert the noodles inside the bowl.</li> 
               <li> Rip open the soup spice packet and pour to the side of the bowl so it will go to the bottom. </li>
               <li> Pour about 400-500 mL of water inside the bowl. If the noodles are broken up, pour around 400. </li>
               <li> Set the lid on the bowl and insert into the microwave and set the wattage to 500 for 7 minutes. </li>
               <li> Take the lid off and add any extra toppings and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
